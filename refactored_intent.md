# Refactored Intent for Breast Cancer Prediction

## Original Intent
"I have Cytology features of breast cancer biopsy. I want to use it to predict breast cancer."

## Refined Intent
To develop a machine learning model that predicts breast cancer diagnosis (benign vs. malignant) based on cytological features extracted from fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset contains digitized measurements of cell nuclei characteristics that can be used to distinguish between benign and malignant breast masses.

### Specific Goals:
1. Create a binary classification model that accurately predicts whether a breast mass is benign (0) or malignant (1)
2. Identify the most important cytological features for breast cancer diagnosis
3. Develop a model with high sensitivity (to minimize false negatives) while maintaining good specificity
4. Provide interpretable results that can potentially assist medical professionals in diagnosis

### Business Value:
- Earlier and more accurate detection of malignant breast masses
- Potential reduction in unnecessary invasive procedures for benign cases
- Support tool for clinicians to improve diagnostic accuracy
- Standardized approach to analyzing cytological features
